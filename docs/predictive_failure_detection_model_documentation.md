# Predictive Failure Detection Model Documentation

## Introduction

This document details the architecture, implementation, and evaluation of the predictive failure detection model for distributed systems. The model leverages a combination of multivariate time series forecasting and real-time anomaly detection techniques to identify early signs of system failures, such as server crashes, disk failures, or service downtime. This integrated approach aims to provide a robust solution for proactive maintenance and resource optimization.

## Model Architecture

The predictive failure detection model is composed of three main components:

1.  **Synthetic Data Generation**: A module to create realistic time-series data simulating system metrics and failure events.
2.  **Time Series Forecasting (LSTM/GRU)**: A component responsible for analyzing historical performance trends (e.g., CPU load, memory usage, disk activity) to predict future behavior and detect deviations.
3.  **Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest/Autoencoder)**: A component that identifies unusual system behavior in real-time, flagging potential impending failures.

These components work in conjunction to provide a comprehensive predictive capability. The time series forecasting models help in understanding normal system evolution and predicting future states, while anomaly detection models pinpoint deviations from these learned patterns or from expected behavior, indicating potential issues.

## Component Details

### 1. Synthetic Data Generation

**Purpose**: To create a dataset that mimics real-world system telemetry, including normal operating conditions, pre-failure indicators, and actual failure events. This synthetic data is crucial for training and testing the predictive models, especially when real-world failure data is scarce or sensitive.

**Key Features**:
-   Generates time-stamped data for multiple system metrics (CPU load, memory usage, disk activity).
-   Introduces gradual increases in metrics before a simulated failure to represent pre-failure symptoms.
-   Includes different types of failures (server crash, disk failure, service downtime).

**Implementation**: The `generate_synthetic_data.py` script creates a CSV file (`synthetic_predictive_maintenance_data.csv`) with the simulated data. The data generation process ensures that there are enough instances of both normal and anomalous behavior for effective model training.

### 2. Time Series Forecasting (LSTM/GRU)

**Purpose**: To learn the temporal dependencies within system metrics and forecast their future values. Significant deviations between predicted and actual values can serve as early warning signs of impending issues.

**Models Used**:
-   **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)**: A type of recurrent neural network (RNN) particularly well-suited for learning long-term dependencies in sequential data. LSTMs are effective in capturing complex patterns in time series data.
-   **Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU)**: A simpler variant of LSTM, often offering comparable performance with fewer parameters, leading to faster training.

**Implementation**: The `TimeSeriesForecaster` class in `time_series_forecasting.py` (and integrated into `predictive_failure_detection.py`) handles:
-   **Data Preparation**: Scaling features using `MinMaxScaler` and creating sequences of data for input to the LSTM/GRU models.
-   **Model Building**: Constructing sequential Keras models with LSTM or GRU layers, followed by dropout for regularization and a dense output layer for regression.
-   **Training**: Training the models using historical data, with `EarlyStopping` to prevent overfitting.
-   **Prediction**: Forecasting future values of key metrics.

### 3. Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest/Autoencoder)

**Purpose**: To identify data points that deviate significantly from the learned normal behavior, indicating potential anomalies that could precede a system failure. This provides a real-time flagging mechanism for unusual events.

**Models Used**:
-   **Isolation Forest**: An ensemble tree-based anomaly detection algorithm that isolates anomalies rather than profiling normal data points. It is efficient and effective for high-dimensional datasets.
-   **Autoencoder**: A neural network trained to reconstruct its input. Anomalies, being different from normal data, will have higher reconstruction errors, which can be used to identify them.

**Implementation**: The `AnomalyDetector` class in `anomaly_detection.py` (and integrated into `predictive_failure_detection.py`) provides functionalities for:
-   **Data Preparation**: Scaling features using `StandardScaler`.
-   **Isolation Forest**: Training and predicting anomalies using the `IsolationForest` algorithm.
-   **Autoencoder**: Building and training a simple feed-forward autoencoder, and then using reconstruction errors to detect anomalies based on a defined threshold (e.g., 95th percentile of errors).

## Model Integration and Evaluation

The `predictive_failure_detection.py` script integrates the time series forecasting and anomaly detection components. In this integrated model, the output of the time series forecasting (predicted metrics) can be used as an input or a reference for the anomaly detection models. For simplicity in this demonstration, the anomaly detection models directly analyze the system metrics, and their anomaly flags are combined.

**Integration Strategy (Example)**:
-   The time series forecasting model predicts the next values of `cpu_load`, `memory_usage`, and `disk_activity`.
-   The anomaly detection models (Isolation Forest and Autoencoder) analyze the current real-time metrics (or the predicted future metrics from the forecaster) to identify deviations.
-   A simple fusion strategy is employed: if either the Isolation Forest or the Autoencoder flags an anomaly, the system considers it a potential impending failure.

**Evaluation Metrics**: The performance of the combined model is evaluated using a classification report, which includes precision, recall, and F1-score. This helps in understanding how well the model identifies actual failures while minimizing false positives.

### Classification Report for Combined Model:
```
              precision    recall  f1-score   support

           0       0.99      0.94      0.96       977
           1       0.02      0.09      0.03        11

    accuracy                           0.93       988
   macro avg       0.50      0.51      0.50       988
weighted avg       0.98      0.93      0.95       988
```

**Analysis of Results**:
-   **Accuracy**: The overall accuracy is 0.93, which seems high, but this can be misleading in imbalanced datasets (where failures are rare).
-   **Precision for class 1 (failures)**: 0.02. This is very low, meaning that when the model predicts a failure, it is correct only 2% of the time. There are many false positives.
-   **Recall for class 1 (failures)**: 0.09. This indicates that the model is only able to detect 9% of the actual failures. This is also very low, meaning many actual failures are missed (false negatives).
-   **F1-score for class 1 (failures)**: 0.03. The F1-score is a harmonic mean of precision and recall, and a low value indicates poor performance in identifying failures.

**Conclusion on Evaluation**: The current combined model, while demonstrating the integration of time series forecasting and anomaly detection, shows very poor performance in accurately predicting failures. This is likely due to:
1.  **Synthetic Data Limitations**: The synthetic data might not fully capture the complexity and subtle patterns of real-world pre-failure indicators.
2.  **Simple Combination Strategy**: A simple OR logic for combining anomaly flags might not be optimal. More advanced fusion techniques (e.g., weighted voting, meta-learning) could improve performance.
3.  **Model Hyperparameters**: The hyperparameters for LSTM/GRU, Isolation Forest, and Autoencoder might not be optimized for this specific task.
4.  **Imbalanced Data Handling**: The dataset is highly imbalanced (50 failures out of 5000 records). More sophisticated techniques for handling imbalanced data (e.g., SMOTE, cost-sensitive learning) are needed.

## Future Improvements

To enhance the model's performance, the following areas should be explored:

-   **Advanced Data Generation**: Develop more sophisticated synthetic data generation methods that incorporate more realistic failure patterns, dependencies between metrics, and external factors.
-   **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Systematically tune the hyperparameters of all models (LSTM, GRU, Isolation Forest, Autoencoder) using techniques like GridSearchCV or Bayesian Optimization.
-   **Feature Engineering**: Explore additional features derived from raw data, such as rolling averages, standard deviations, and rates of change, which can provide more context to the models.
-   **Sophisticated Anomaly Scoring**: Instead of binary anomaly flags, use continuous anomaly scores from Isolation Forest and Autoencoder, and then apply a learned threshold or a more complex decision-making process.
-   **Ensemble Methods**: Investigate more advanced ensemble techniques that combine the strengths of forecasting and anomaly detection models in a more intelligent way.
-   **Real-world Data**: Ultimately, testing and training with real-world system data will be crucial for developing a truly effective predictive maintenance solution.
-   **Root Cause Analysis Integration**: Integrate the predictive model with root cause analysis components (as outlined in the original project document) to not only predict failures but also identify their underlying causes.

This documentation serves as a foundation for further development and refinement of the predictive failure detection system. The initial implementation demonstrates the feasibility of the approach, but significant work is required to achieve production-ready performance.
